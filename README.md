# Python Fundamentals Portfolio

A collection of Python projects demonstrating core programming concepts including data manipulation, control flow, functions, and data structures. These projects showcase foundational skills that form the basis for data analysis work.

## Projects Overview

This portfolio contains three projects that progressively demonstrate Python fundamentals:

1. **Customer Order Report** - String manipulation and conditional logic
2. **Grade Analyzer** - Data cleaning and dictionary/DataFrame conversion
3. **Movie Dataset Analysis** - List processing and custom sorting algorithms

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning**: String manipulation, type conversion, standardization
- **Data Structures**: Lists, dictionaries, nested data structures
- **Control Flow**: Conditional statements, loops, iteration
- **Functions**: Creating reusable code with proper documentation
- **Data Processing**: Calculations, aggregations, filtering
- **Pandas Integration**: Converting processed data to DataFrames
